# Introduction

## LaTeX Formula

Here is a LaTeX formula for the quadratic equation:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Looks pretty innit? $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
Alea jacta est

# The rest

## R Code

```{r, echo=F}
# test
plot(cars)
```

Here is something else

`{r} 1+1` ok?


```{r}
#| layout: [[1,1], [1]]
library(dygraphs)
dygraph(fdeaths, "Female Deaths")
dygraph(mdeaths, "Male Deaths")
dygraph(ldeaths, "All Deaths")
```

## Other section

I'm highly confused with the organisation of this document. Are you not?


## something else

How much can we fit in one page?
